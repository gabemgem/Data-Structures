I made 4 test cases. The first had just a word that was too big and ran
 in .033 seconds. The second had an open spot to test the filling and
 removing duplicates, which ran in .019 seconds. The third had a positive
 and negative word that was the same, which ran in .02 seconds. Finally 
 the fourth one just had all of the letters negative except for z, which 
 ran in .019 seconds.
