DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC: 
Please be clear & concise!  What is your hypothesis for the creation
of this statistic?

In League of Legends, after each match you are given a score for how well you did in the match.
This score is based off of a lot more things than we are given in the input file, but I thought
a good way to tell how good you did in a match is how many of the kills you participated in. That
includes kills and assists because often there are people in the game just trying to help other 
players get kills, and, if they are doing really well, they are getting a lot of assists.
I have also given each player a grade according to their kill participation. I found that the 
grade is very far from the standard school grade system because getting a third of the kills is 
very good even if it only gives you 33% kill participation.

RESULTS FROM 3RD STATISTIC:
Paste in a small amount of sample output into this file, or list the
file names of sample input & output included with your submisssion.
Describe what is interesting about your statistic on this data.

This was taken from the input_medium.txt output. It was interesting to note that, in games with
a lot more kills and assists, you get a better spreading out of grades, whereas games with fewer 
kills/assists have more concentrated grades.
